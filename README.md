<h2>Form Validation</h2>
<p>It is like a checkout page, where user can give their billing & shipping address. In the billing address, if the
    user checks the "same as shipping address", it will automatically render user's name, address, city & mobile
    number from the
    shipping address. After that user can't change anything. If they want to do so,
    then they need to uncheck the "same as shipping address" option & fill them again.</p>
<h2>How to run the app</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Download the file as zip & extract it</li>
